# train-times

What I used to make this project: HTML, Bootstrap, Firebase, Jquery

This project is a train schedule application using Moment.js. This could be used for up-to-date info about train times, but for testing purposes, input train names and times as you'd like. The website will do the rest â€” retrieving, outputting and keeping track of the data. 

Is there something you think this project would be helpful with in your day-to-day? Reach out and let's chat about the logic.
